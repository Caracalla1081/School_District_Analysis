In the cell below, write a few sentences to describe any discoveries you made while performing your analysis along with any additional analysis you believe would be worthwhile.

After performing the cleaning and analysis on the student data provided, it is my belief that much more parsing and drilling into the data needs to be performed to gather any valuable insights into factors that may contribute to test score performances between individual schools and Charter versus Public.

For instance, in comparing "school_type" by "math_score", we can see that charter schools saw a decline in performance from 9th grade to 12th grade by 10 points, whereas public schools did not see any meaningful change over the four years of high school, but it is not clear here why. Without a better breakdown of comparisons between school test score performances by "school_budget" and "student_count" by "school_name" or "school_type" it appears difficult to draw any solid conclusions on why the drop-off in performance in charter schools and stagnation in public schools.

Another datapoint that would prove useful would be to break out school budgets by grade, and group by school and/or type, with the "math_score" and "reading_score" means included. We could potentially then determine if schools are acknowledging or providing more resources based on grade level, and if so, ask why.

The analysis could even be done on "student_count" and "student_budget" by "school_name" and/or "school_type", giving us the ability to breakout avg. spending per student and also what are the schools that have an outsized budget based on their "student_count", and can resources be guided to other schools, primarily in-between public schools.

As it stands the main takeaway from the analysis above is that public schools have larger budgets than charter schools, but the results related to math scores appear to be indistinguishable from each other.
